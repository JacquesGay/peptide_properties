These codes were developed to investigate the physical properties of miniproteins over the course of a simulation.

nestiness_analysis_functions.py is built to be able to work independently and is used for solution analysis

adsorption_analysis.py is built to call on nestiness_analysis_functions.py for analysis of physical properties while relying internally to evaluate peptide contacts with a surface.

This code is a rough draft. It is currently underdevelopment to turn into a user-friendly python package
